OR OTHERWISE AFFLIATED WITH SOE AND THE PLANETSIDE 2 TEAM.

What is this project?
=========

This project aims to generate data statistics about Alerts on various servers. Initially, this will only be allowed on the
Miller EU server as a trial, but hopefully with time this can be expanded to other servers in the future if the project
proves to be successful.

The website that will be created will include the ability to submit data (along with in-built validation) show statistics in 
a nice, graphical fashion, and if we really get to it, Alert Hotspots, where the most hottest facilities will be highlighted
on a map of each continant.

To-do list
=========

* Set up submission area and initial datasets
* Set up basic graphical data (text form)
* Develop advanced graphics (graphs / charts etc)
